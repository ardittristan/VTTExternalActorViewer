_For when your dm has too many worlds._

## Installation

If you click this button a popup will open with an url in it:

If you click on the \[ [Go to Application](https://ardittristan.github.io/VTTExternalActorSite/) \] button it opens the character sheet in a new window. This url to your character should work as long as the Foundry server is online. No matter what world it is on (as long as the world has ran with this plugin at least once.)
